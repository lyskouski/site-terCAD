<p>
Any made contribution is greatly appreciated (also, by mentioning in Contributors section, Release notes, 
and in the "App" [About - Contributors] as a gratitude). However, if it's been chosen a contribution (not just typo 
corrections) to any of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lyskouski?tab=repositories">repos</a>, you agree 
that you're giving us a non-exclusive license to use that content, as we deem appropriate. You probably guessed that 
already, but we do want to be extra clear on that.
</p>

<p><em>
Any work should be rewarded, but until we reach profitability (check the "Finance" tab), we will not be able to 
financially support your work.
